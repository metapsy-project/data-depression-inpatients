## **The `data-inpatients` dataset** ðŸ“Š 

The `data-inpatients` dataset is part of the meta-analytic research domain ([MARD](https://docs.metapsy.org/uploads/ebmental-2022-300509.pdf)) on psychotherapy for depression. This MARD is part of the [Metapsy project](https://www.metapsy.org/). The dataset contains study information and effect size data of depression psychotherapy trials in inpatients. The date of the last search update is provided [here](https://github.com/metapsy-project/data-inpatients/blob/main/metadata/last_search.txt). 

This dataset includes psychotherapy vs. control (`psy vs ctr`) and psychotherapy vs. psychotherapy comparisons (`psy vs psy`; this information is included in the `comparison` column). It also includes multiple outcome calculation types within studies (e.g. means and SD *and* remission), which can be filtered with the "primary_outcome_type" variable. 

The dataset follows the [Metapsy data standard](https://docs.metapsy.org/data-preparation/format/).
