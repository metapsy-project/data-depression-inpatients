For example, if a multiarm trial employed two types of CBT interventions, face-to-face and Internet-based, this variable would be set to f2f and Internet, respectively.",
"multi_arm2": "In multiarm trials, this variable provides a specification of the type of treatment used in the second arm. This variable is set to NA (missing) when the study was not a multiarm trial. For example, if a multiarm trial employed two types of control groups, waitlist and placebo, this variable would be set to wl and plac, respectively. Typically, multiarm trials employ two or more active treatments (e.g. CBT and problem-solving therapy), which are compared to the same control group (e.g. a waitlist). This means that values in multi_arm2 do not differ (e.g. they are always wl for this specific multiarm trial); nevertheless, the variable should be specified in the dataset.",
